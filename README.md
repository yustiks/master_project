Project was created for classification and object detection tasks in satellite images. 

There are two parts: classification of images which have car and do not have car and object localization of ships in satellite images. 
For the classification part I created dataset of 1000 images which have cars and 1000 images which do not include any car. 
generate_cars.py - generate patches from the initial dataset of 1000 images to 8000 images (rotated and scaled)
