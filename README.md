# Computer vision project for ships and boats detection from satellite images.

Project was created as classification and object detection task in satellite images. 

There are two parts: classification of images which have car and do not have car and object localization of ships (boats) in satellite images. 

For the classification part I created dataset of 1000 images which have cars and 1000 images which do not include any car. 

generate_cars.py - generate patches from the initial dataset of 1000 images to 8000 images (rotated and scaled)

## Notebooks
